*The Dame* is commited to collecting and distributing the discussion fodder for the BYU ACME cohort of 2026. The only thesis is "Tell me more." I hope for this space to be primarily for the in-house writing of the cohort. However, I am also excited in its potential as a forum for writing and ideas discovered by members of the cohort.  

As I am fabulously wealthy and occaisionally bored, I am happy to sponsor the whole venture. Free content is the original sin of the internet--consider this site charitably donated. I vow that there will never be ads or equivalently that the site will be poorly mantained by amateurs. The reader-view style will save me a few clicks.

*The Dame* is committed to slow media and thoughtful responses. No opportunity for reactions or comments will encourage readers to be more measured in their responses to pieces on *The Dame*, which we hope to publish as well. This is conclusively because a non-static site is more difficult (see previous section), and retroactively because of my commitment to a more savoury approach to media consumption. 

I am not looking for polemic or controversy--sensationalists and provacateurs are some of the most boring people to be around. I am interested in the second look, the discovery, the humble opinion, the heretic even, but not the attention magician. I liked *The Crown* better than *Tiger King*. Hurtful, demeaning, condescending nor fearful pieces will have a place on the Dame, either for original publication or for rounding up.  

To submit a self-written piece, please copy and paste your writing (in markdown would be best) into an email to madame@readthedame.com, along with any pictures you would like to include. PDFs are also great.

To submit a rounded up piece to share, send the link as well as a short one-sentence teaser.  

I'm excited to hear from you,  
Madame Simsbury
