*The Dame* is commited to collecting and distributing the discussion fodder for the BYU ACME cohort of 2026. The only thesis is "Tell me more." I hope for this space to be primarily for the in-house writing of the cohort. However, I am also excited in its potential as a forum for writing and ideas discovered by members of the cohort.

Slow media, thoughtful responses. Conclusively because a non-static site is more difficult, and retroactively because of our commitment to slow and thoughtful media.

I am not looking for polemic or controversy--sensationalists and provacateurs are some of the most boring people to be around. I am interested in the second look, the discovery, the humble opinion, the heretic even, but not the attention magician. I liked *The Crown* better than *Tiger King*. Hurtful, demeaning, condescending nor fearful pieces will have a place on the Dame, either for original publication or for rounding up.

To submit a self-written piece, please copy and paste your writing here (in markdown would be best), along with any pictures you would like to include.

To submit a rounded up piece to share, submit the link as well as a short one-sentence teaser.

I'm excited to hear from you,
Madame Simsbury
