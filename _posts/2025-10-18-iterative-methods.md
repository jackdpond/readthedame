Madame Simsbury,

Thank you for being willing to sponsor an endeavor like The Dame. I'm excited about it, and I hope to be able to explain why--If you can forgive a tacky math title like the one I used today.

Recently, I finished a little personal project I had been working on for a while<sup>1</sup> and called my friend and obsessive creator Jack Cook to let him know I had finally wrapped it up (for now). He congratulated me, we chatted about where the project could go, and I hedged all my bets by telling him how messy and scrappy the whole thing is. He said, "Yeah, well, but you did it and it's out there. Now you just need to iterate."

I really think there is something to that.

Ray Bradbury, whom I consider to be among the greatest short story writers of the 20th century, had this to say:

>The best hygiene for beginning writers or intermediate writers is to write a hell of a lot of short stories. If you can write one short story a week—it doesn’t matter what the quality is to start, but at least you’re practicing, and at the end of the year you have 52 short stories, and I defy you to write 52 bad ones. Can’t be done. At the end of 30 weeks or 40 weeks or at the end of the year, all of a sudden a story will come that’s just wonderful.<sup>2</sup>

To further develop what I want to get at, I want to look at two or three of my favorite webcomics. I am a faithful follower of Randall Munroe's XKCD and Zach Weinersmith's Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal. XKCD updates every Monday Wednesday Friday, and SMBC six days a week, and I rarely miss either. I regard these two writers/artists/comedians/philosphers/scientists as human collussi. Genius. Larger than life. Clever, insightful, articulate, creative--so much of what I want to be<sup>3</sup>. 

Webcomics are a special case of iteration, because the artist doesn't just keep making things in isolation, they publish to an audience--that means higher stakes and lots of feedback. This is Zach Weinersmith's first SMBC comic, published on September 5, 2002.

A few weeks later, on September 17, he published this comic:

This stuff is pretty awful. At this stage the jokes are like packing peanuts. They're all like that in the begining, if not worse. And yet Zach kept at it, publishing his comics every other day and eventually daily. 

In September 2005, three years later, Randall Munroe decided to scan some of his bored doodles and artistic sketches and post them online. Here are some early ones.

Randall Munroe never displayed the bad taste for jokes that Zach reveled in early on, but it took a bit for him to find his niche, and a bit longer for his niche to find him. In 2007 he gained prominence through a series of comics he did making maps of the internet.

Randall has had his finger on the pulse of internet users and nerds since the start--from chatrooms and blogs to online games, development teams to research labs, students and professors, for the fields of math, physics, biology, linguistics, and just general nerd-dom, Randall has produced the *canonical* content for the internet age. Some examples.

Zach took off as well. He's a different kind of nerd that Randall, and the voice he has found over the years is different. His undergraduate is in literature and his PhD is in Ecology, and his interest in both literature (and authors) and science (and scientists) show in his comics. 

Let's look at his most recently published comic, which conveniently for my thesis, is objectively brilliant.

And for no other reason than my enjoyment and yours, enjoy a small sampling of my favorite SMBC comics (limited by space--his comics [are](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/qualia) [generally](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3) [pretty](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-03-21) [long](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-12-07)).

Now these guys did more than just make comics in order to become great at writing comics. They grew up, experienced more things, read more, met more people.<sup>4</sup> However, I don't think those things would have made them better comic artists if they weren't making comics *the whole time*. What they learned and picked up got folded into their comics *because* they were outputting constantly. If Zach or Randall started today, even with lots of the same context in their lives, they wouldn't be the great comic artists they are today. 

When asked about how he created so much good content so prolificly, Zach simply said, "I try very hard to read a lot and write a lot."

With the amount of work both Zach and Randall have produced, it is inevitable that the garbage is forgotten. I would a million times rather have produced a ton of terrible work and a ton of great work than a little bit of great work alone. Back to Bradbury:

>Whatever it is—whatever it is, do it! Sure there are going to be mistakes. Everything’s not going to be perfect. I’ve written thousands of words that no one will ever see. I had to write them in order to get rid of them. But then I’ve written a lot of other stuff too. So the good stuff stays, and the old stuff goes.<sup>5</sup>

Packs of snow sitting at the top of the hill never have to roll all the way down, but they stay just packs of snow! Bad ideas never become decent ideas which never become good ideas which never become great ideas until they are tried and improved, until they are formed and given life, until they land with a *clunk* in reality.

Greatness in any pursuit is the result (or asymptote? If I'm sticking with the analogy?) of deliberate and consistent effort over a long period of time. And the iterations are just the embodiment of the quest, where the abstract touches down. Iterations are the footprints left by the quester.

I care about writing, and I want to be a great writer. To me, that means iteration. I also want to be able to say, "I try very hard to read a lot and write a lot". Until now, that has looked like too-long emails to family members and sometimes professors, which is a limited audience with too many incentives to tell me I'm great at writing.<sup>6</sup> I hope the Dame can be a good playground to produce and experiment with a supportive and honest audience I see nearly every day. There is the perfect cost surface.

Best,
Jackson

Also, on entertaining: 

>Also, in general, if you’re an entertainer, you have precisely one job – be more interesting than the people you are entertaining. Otherwise why should they listen to you. That’s why if you want to improve at your work, self-cultivation is the best route.  
Remember, you get paid to be more insightful than people who don’t write. That means you have to read more and think more."
