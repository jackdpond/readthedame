Dearest Madame Simsbury,

Behind closed doors, when the other stem majors aren’t watching, the applied math folk talk about everything except for math. Maybe it’s merely avoidant; the conversation seems too excitable for that. In my many forays behind their lines, I have heard discussions about the best way to roast vegetables, whether CS Lewis would have made a good mormon after all, the lives and times of one Richard Posner, obscure and sometimes frightening-sounding musical genres, the tamer side of pole dancing, the surprising sophistication of cave art, pros and cons of hyperactivity medication, effective strategies for faith dialog, ted chiang’s science fiction opposed to ray bradbury’s, and careful probing policy discussions praising moderation and careful listening. I’ve wondered why this is. I don’t have any idea, but apparently applied math attracts interesting people who wish math was their side gig, whether it is or not. 

Whatever the reason, I want to hear more about it! Tell me more about the modern epic poet tucked into nathan’s famous hot dog eating competition and the best places to get fresh cheap produce and your own novels and the world of collegiate power lifting!  

I’d like to start a little publication, a magazine or a gazette or perhaps a periodical—maybe even a pamphlet, press piece, or printed paper. I think it would make for a meaningful joint venture.

Let me know what you think.

Best,
The Doctor
