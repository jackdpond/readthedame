Dear Madame Simsbury,

For an unknown reason, there were a few years of my life when I received collections of fairly tales for every Christmas and birthday. I never asked for them, but I should have, and I'm glad I got them. So I read a lot of fairy tales, and I adore the genre. I love the warm but sometimes brittle or stock word choice (I think quaint is the word), and the alternating happy and grisly endings.

The following is a retelling of a fairy tale I am sure I read once but have never been able to find again, with some of my own embellishments. I originally wrote it in high school, but have revised it a few times in the years since. This is the first time it is appearing with a title because it's the story's first time outside of my Google Keep, where it is simply titled, "My Very Own Fairy Tale".

I hope you and your audience enjoy.

A long time ago, in a country far away, there lived a princess. All who knew her could attest to her tender compassion, her keen intelligence, but most obviously, her radiant beauty--for she was silent. Not a sound had escaped her lips since she cried as a newborn. She read voraciously and listened attentively to visiting storytellers, and capably took care of every needful thing in her life. Despite years of worries and pleas from her parents, the king and queen, she showed no interest in the spoken word--or at the very least not her own. The princess had a faithful and intelligent dog who heeded her unspoken desires. Her dog was her dearest friend and perpetual companion.

Mere weeks before the princess' eighteenth birthday, the girl still had not spoken. Desperate to hear a word from her, and unable to coax them out of her himself, her father the King offered the princess' hand in marriage to the man that could make her speak. The princess, upon hearing her father's decree, only smiled, and made it known that each hopeful suitor would meet her in a room alone with her and her dog--and that her clever dog would decide when the interview was finished. Many a man entered into the room with the princess only to be chased out again by the vicious barking dog--if they were fast enough. 

Now, there were three brothers in the employ of the King who wished for the hand of the princess. The eldest helped to prepare the royal family's food. It was he who decided to attempt for the princess's hand first. Upon entering the room of the princess, he gently and charmingly entreated her with promises of love and comfort, promising to be the most loving husband in all the earth if only she would say she accepted him. His promises and his handsome face prompted a faint smile from the princess, but she was not moved to speak. At a look from his master, the princess's dog leaped up and bit out the eldest brother's throat. It was thus that the eldest brother failed. 

The second brother was an apprenticed silversmith, and had had a part in creating some of the princess’ mirrors and fine jewelry. His brother's death caused some reluctance, but at last, he decided he too would risk death for the hand of the princess. He had had some small interactions with the princess, and desired her even more ardently than his elder brother. Upon entering the princess's room, he promised her many beautiful things--trinkets and jewelry, dresses and crafts. He swore to fill her world with the cleverest and richest objects in all the earth. His entreaty met only with a cold stern look from the princess, and the dog hardly waited for her glance before he leaped upon the second brother, and tore out his throat. He fared not as long as the first brother.

The youngest brother was the fairest and the cleverest. He worked as a delivery boy in the palace library. It was often his task to run into town to buy the books with which the princess furnished her bookshelf. This prized shelf was the princess’ main amusement, and, when he could, the youngest brother stepped into her room to place the books himself. Once or twice he had dared to purchase a book not on the princess's list. He was not at all daunted by his brothers' failure, and crafted a plan whereby to hear the princess's voice.

Upon entering the princess's room, he bowed deeply to the princess, and received a nod and a small smile in return. The princess even seemed to recognize him. The youngest brother then turned and addressed the dog. "Hail, honorable Champ"--for he alone among the suitors was familiar with the dog's name--"I have a small question to put to you. I have hope that you can help me."

The dog sat attentively, his head cocked to one side, as if eager to answer the youth's query.

"There were once three skilled craftsmen who traveled together. The first was a carpenter, the second a tailor, the third a storyteller. One night as they set up camp, they drew lots for watches during the night. The carpenter drew first watch. In order to avoid sleepiness, he began to carve the semblance of a beautiful woman on the log he sat on. He became lost in his work, and soon finished a complete carving of an impossibly beautiful woman, created with such skill as to be indistinguishable from a woman of flesh and blood.”

Sitting back in her couch, the princess wore a bemused, mildly interested expression. The youth’s strategy was a new one. He continued.

“When the carpenter’s watch was over, he awoke the tailor, and fell asleep. The tailor, upon discovering the lovely woman, spent his watch cutting and sewing a gorgeous dress suitable for the carving.  Arrayed in her attire so skillfully made, the woman was even more lovely.”
  
The princess was sitting up straighter now, her brow furrowed and her eyes fixed on the book boy she had hardly noticed until today. He went on, 
  
“When the tailor’s watch was finished, he awoke the storyteller, and fell asleep. The storyteller could hardly miss the beautiful woman, so dexterously formed and dressed, and wasted no time teaching her to speak. He taught her how to use her voice to express feeling, to reason, to command, caress, and correct. By morning she was delightfully articulate and charming."

By now the princess was leaning forward in her chair, her eyes wide and bright, enraptured by the handsome young man and his story, his sharp mind, and his playful eyes.

“When the storyteller’s companions awoke, each laid claim to the lady to which each had contributed. The carpenter contended that since he had given her form, she was his to keep. The tailor argued that he had given her dress and made her presentable, and was his to wed. The storyteller quietly answered that because he had given her speech, she was his to love.”

“Dear wise Champ, to which of these skilled craftsmen does the woman belong?”

The faithful dog, who had remained silent and attentive throughout the youth’s tale, now cocked his head the other way, as if thinking. At last, he bowed his head as if to acquiesce the answer, and looked to his master.

The princess, who by now had fallen quite in love with the handsome youth, looked down and blushed, before steadily meeting the adoring gaze of our hero. In the sweet smooth tone of a brand new voice, she answered, “The dilemma is solved as easily as the query is posed to the lady in question--the choice is hers. Any woman knows what she would decide. The woman's heart belongs to the man who gave her speech, for forever after all her loving words belong to him.”

The third brother responded, “And so you are mine, my love, now and forever after.”

He offered the princess his arm and they left the room together. They were wed that very same day.

They lived happily ever after.

The end.
