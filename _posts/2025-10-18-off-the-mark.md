**Student**: What is analogy?  
**Teacher**: Well that is hard to say. I guess I would say analogy is like a change of basis matrix. It takes one from one hard to understand basis to one we can understand and then you can change it back to better understand its original context. A simple matrix multiplication back and forth.

**Student**: Then everything must be analogous. Each part comparable to another. So then the spaces must be isomorphic?  
**Teacher**: Well not really and that is where analogy fails.

**Student**: So what is analogy?  
**Teacher**: Let me explain it this way. Analogy is like numerical analysis. Some things are extremely hard to understand. They may be impalpable, even impossible to comprehend. So we approximate as best we can for those who do not understand as a way to bring the incomprehensible to reality. Take the bits we do know bring it down from the ether to the gritty matter we can claim. We get as close to things as we can.

**Student**: That would imply we do not understand any thing at all. We approximate what we do not understand with things we do though we do not know how they join together. We approximate with little reason for why it is the way it is. Then the parts we do know we throw in error for the heck of it. We must only assume our approximation is correct for something we do not understand in the first place. So what is analogy?  
**Teacher**: I will try this then. Analogy is like a story. There is a life I want to teach you, a lifestyle, principles, a morality, a whole series of choices to pare down the vast possibilities of existence in the time of a lecture. One must reduce it down to a discrete list to thus prepare you for what is to come. So I will teach you in a moment’s notice what I want you to be. You will watch the theater, the actors and the crew, to understand what you should become. Analogy will pare down the complexity to give you the grasp and the morality you should have. Take in the important truths and trash the less savory. I will impart an entire paradigm in the fables and mythos of analogy just for you.

**Student**: But there is no guarantee my life will be like the one you propose. A butterfly’s wingbeat or World War III or androids propositions a whole new array of choices that will leave my existence irreconcilable with the reality you endured much, much less the fantasy you fashion for me. I will not be able to use this prior knowledge to adjust to my current circumstances. My show will either become a mess of anachronisms or a repeat of antiquity. I will miss the nuance, the fine demarcation of relationships between friends, or the exact grainy texture of brick on the pads of my three fingers as my arm trails behind my walk in the hallway of a building I know all too well. I can’t miss that or forget it. Where is the benefit? What is analogy?  
**Teacher**: Hmmm may I say analogy is like Schrodinger's Cat. It is something else given whether it is articulated or not. It is without form and without shape. It lies between the real and ethereal. For when you consider it as an object it depicts an abstraction. It vanishes in between breaths of words and the spaces of type. It cannot be tied to a specific object or something to grasp. But when you chase after it through gaps of our tangible matter into the world of notions, it becomes physical. It is like a collage, a depiction, an image, a painting, a photo, a sculpture, a speech, and everything aside from the very thought it resembles. We can see the parallels, make the connections, and draw the lines between both. Analogy either escapes out of its box into the world of living or is found dead at a murder scene, killed by falling short of reality. 

**Student**: Then I guess I will never know.  
**Teacher**: And I guess I will never say.
